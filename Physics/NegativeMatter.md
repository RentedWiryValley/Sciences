## Negative matter and Newton's second law of motion

#### Existing knowledge and theories

Negative matter, which is more commonly known as [negative mass](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negative_mass), a kind of [exotic matter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_matter), is a hypothetical form of matter whose mass is negative.

Negative matter is thought to have a bizarre characteristic that a force that pushes on a negative matter object makes it move against the force, and subsequently, a negative matter object and a regular/positive matter object move in the same direction in spite that the latter repels the former. Similarly, a negative matter object makes another negative matter object move away from it in spite that there is a gravitational pull between them.

Negative matter behaves these ways because of Newton’s second law of motion:

```
F⃗ =ma⃗
```

If `m` is negative, the direction of `a⃗` would be opposite to `F⃗`.

#### My take

The real Newton's second law of motion may be

```
F⃗ =|m|a⃗
```

With the new formula, the following statements are true:

- Everything we know works exactly the same because `m` of any object in our world is (defined as) positive.
- Negative matter behaves the same way as regular/positive matter because the sign of `m` does not matter.
- The matter that makes up our world may be negative matter.
