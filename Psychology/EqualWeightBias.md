## Equal weight bias

Equal weight bias is the tendency for people to weigh different things equally, even when there are apparent or even significant differences.

Some examples of equal weight bias include:

- [Law of Triviality](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Law_of_triviality)
- Smaller problems can cause the same level of emotions as bigger ones.
- People tend to weigh opinions from others with different levels of knowledge, experience, and competency equally.

Equal weight bias is a kind of cognitive bias that is based on [**presence bias**](PresenceBias.md).
