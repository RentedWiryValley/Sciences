## Presence bias & absence bias

#### Presence bias

Presence bias is the tendency for people to react when exposed to something relatively new, be it an object, person, idea, action, phenomenon, and so on, and the more times there is the exposure, the more likely there will be a reaction.

**Positive reaction principle** is an important trait of presence bias. It refers to the tendency for people to react positively to a presence when there is no obvious reason for objection. Positive reactions to a presence include accepting it, favoring it, being happy with it, and so on.

Presence bias is an instinct of reaction. It is a subconscious mechanism built into animals, including humans, for survival in the wild world. It helps animals adapt to the environment and attain variety in nutrition and reproduction.

Presence bias is based on understanding, including misunderstanding and lack of understanding. Since children's knowledge is more limited than adults', they are more susceptible to presence bias, therefore, more likely to develop problematic ideas and behaviors.

Presence bias is an underline mechanism of many cognitive biases. It is the or one foundation of the following phenomena:

- [Bandwagon effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bandwagon_effect)
- [In-group favoritism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-group_favoritism)
- [Misinformation effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Misinformation_effect)
- [Recency bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recency_bias)
- [Stockholm syndrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome)
- [Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship_bias)
- [The squeaky wheel gets the grease.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_squeaky_wheel_gets_the_grease)
- [**Equal weight bias**](EqualWeightBias.md)
- Advertisements work.
- Politicians make appearances a lot, especially before elections.
- No publicity is bad publicity.
- When false claims are repeated, people start to believe they are true.
- Reverse psychology works.
- Bans make non-users want the banned, and users want the banned more.
- Self-deprecating humor can become detrimental.
- People stay in abusive relationships.
- Making appearances is important in courtship.
- Long-distance relationships usually cannot compete with short-distance attractions.
- Windfall gainers, including lottery winners, often go broke.
- Children do what their parents do, not what their parents tell them to do.
- A good way to respond to a child's minor inappropriate behaviors is to not respond.

#### Absence bias

Absence bias is the other side of the same coin. It is the tendency for people to not respond to absent things.

Similar to the positive reaction principle of presence bias, there is the **negative response principle** of absence bias. It refers to the tendency for people to think negatively about the absent. For example, when something is absent, people tend to consider it unnecessary, undesirable, nonexistent, and so on.

Absence bias is the or one foundation of the following phenomena:

- [Endowment effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_effect)
- [Omission bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omission_bias)
- [Status quo bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Status_quo_bias)
- [**Loss bias**](LossBias.md)
- People stay in abusive relationships.
- Long-distance relationships usually cannot compete with short-distance attractions.
- Some people, especially females, in relationships need to be reassured that they are loved.

#### Discussions

Females' presence bias and absence bias are stronger than males. Children's presence bias and absence bias are stronger than adults.

In a wider definition, presence bias can include both presence bias and absence bias.

###### Stockholm syndrome

Stockholm syndrome is a psychological bias developed in a process of survival. It can be explained with presence bias, which is a survival mechanism.

The reason why hostages develop trust in their captors is that they subconsciously adopt a way of thinking similar to the one used in [anthropic principle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anthropic_principle):

If one can survive to observe a situation, the situation must be life-sustaining, and subsequently, safe. If one can survive around a person, the latter must be harmless.

###### Abusive relationships / domestic violence

People stay in abusive relationships, including domestic violence. The phenomenon is more prominent in females. Both presence bias and absence bias play an important role. Females having stronger presence bias and absence bias is one of the reasons why the phenomenon is more common in them.

Presence bias makes people feel some level of safety and have some level of trust in abusive relationships, similar to Stockholm syndrome. Absence bias makes people feel unsafe to leave their partners and seek help from other people. Both the unknown life and unknown people are scary. Absence bias may play a bigger role than presence bias.

To help females escape abusive relationships, measures can be taken for both biases, especially absence bias. Simply put, they need to feel safe to seek help from other people and/or organizations. Some potential policies include:

- Make regular exposures to relevant organizations, including the police, people, and processes part of the compulsory education, starting from high schools.
- Make the exposure a public service.
- Advertise the service.

###### Child protection / domestic violence

Children are born to adapt. They have the strongest presence bias among all people. What is present in childhood is considered normal subconsciously throughout the whole life. It is why child protection is utterly important.

###### Long-distance relationships

Long-distance relationships usually don't work. Both presence bias and absence bias play an important role, and the former is likely more significant. Short-distance attractions and quasi-relationships are more appealing because of presence bias.

###### Violence in video games

There are arguments about whether playing games with violence promotes violence. Presence bias dictates the answer to be yes. Similarly, presence bias dictates that movies, even stories with violence promote violence, too. One of the reasons why it is hard to be concluded through observations is that consistency is hard to find, which is because the probability of the influence being effective is low.

Children are more likely to develop violence through video game playing because they lack understandings, which is the foundation of presence bias.

In addition to violence, any element in games promotes itself. An example would be that two children in China jumped off a building to experience flying and respawning, i.e., revival.

#### Animal presence bias

Animals' presence bias is as strong as, if not stronger than, humans'. It is because presence bias is a survival mechanism.

What plays an important role in an animal's presence bias when it faces another animal or a moving/changing object includes:

- size, including volume and height
- distance
- speed, including both movement speed and rate of changing (of colors, for example)
- sound volume
- weight (by the sense of ground trembling)

Some examples of animal presence bias include:

- [Filial imprinting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Imprinting_(psychology)#Filial_imprinting)
- [Herd behavior](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_behavior)
- A larger size is instinctively considered more severe if it is a threat and can be more favorable if it is courtship.
- Some predators pay little to no attention to unmoving, i.e., (seemingly) dead, animals.
- Some preys freeze or play dead when in danger. It is an instinct that corresponds to the aforementioned predators' bias.

There is no clear boundary between human and animal presence bias. The effects can exist in both groups, such as herd behavior.
