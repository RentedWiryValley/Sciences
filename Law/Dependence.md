## Dependence

Dependence is a kind of legal interpersonal relationship in which one party is unable or disallowed to take action to exercise its fundamental legal rights, such as health, life, safety, security, freedom, and justice, and it depends on the other party to do it.

Some examples of dependence include:

- parent-child relationship
- doctor-patient relationship
- operator-passenger relationship
	- captain-passenger relationship
	- pilot-passenger relationship
	- conductor-passenger relationship
	- driver-passenger relationship
- the relationship between a driver and a pedestrian who is in the vehicle's way
- the relationship between a carer and a caree who is to some extent unable, e.g., overaged, underaged, sick, comatose, disabled, and so on
- the relationship between a causer and a victim of an accident/negligence
- the relationship between a police officer and a victim of an ongoing crime
- the relationship between a firefighter and a sufferer of an ongoing fire
- the relationship between a commercial facility provider and its users
- the relationship between a worker in an essential public utility supplier and the users of the supplier
- the relationship between a solider and the citizens of the country
- the relationship between a government investigative department and a victim of a crime in the relevant department
- the relationship between a prosecutor and a victim of a crime
- marriage

Some reasons for the inability and disallowance include:

- lack of knowledge/skills/expertise
- lack of information
- lack of means
- lack of tools
- lack of time
- lack of health
- lack of legality, for example, a medical license
- lack of power, for example, the power to captain a ship

Most dependence relationships are an inevitable outcome of the differentiation of social roles and legal rights.

#### Characteristics

There are some distinctive characteristics of dependence, compared to other legal interpersonal relationships, such as contract and fiduciary duty:

- When the conditions are met, dependence can temporarily or lastingly suppress any legal rights of the dependee, potentially including the right to life.
- Breach of dependence is a crime. Even with no harm done, breach of dependence is potentially criminalizable.
- The burden of proof lies in the dependee in the cases in which the depender is unable to collect or preserve evidence.

Because of these characteristics, dependence is the gravest legal relationship.

#### Breach of dependence

Breach of dependence happens with the dependee's willful actions or inactions that do not match the depender's best interests in relation to the aspect of the dependence. There is likely no difference between actions in dependence and actions not in dependence, which have been well established in law. However, inactions have not been thoroughly studied.

#### Inaction variants

For research purpose, the following terminologies are coined as variants of inaction: nonaction, pseudoaction, unaction, deaction, and antiaction.

| Terminology | Description | Example |
|----|----|----|
| Nonaction | One elects not to take an action that is its obligation. | Parents leave children unattended and go to the cinema. |
| Unaction | One refrains itself from doing something of its obligation that would naturally happen if without the consideration/decision. | A doctor stops itself from saving a patient because the patient intends to reveal its crime. |
| Pseudoaction | One knowingly takes an (potentially) ineffective action that appears to fulfill its obligation. | A doctor pretends to be treating the patient by prescribing a medicine that it knows most likely would not work. |
| Deaction | One wittingly undoes an action that is its obligation. | A surgeon damages a successfully done procedure in order for the patient to die. |
| Antiaction | One stops someone else's soon-to-happen action from happening, or an ongoing action from being continued/finished, when the action is the obligation of the latter. | Both Doctor A and Doctor B look after a patient. Doctor A is going to properly treat and save the patient. Doctor B tricks Doctor A into not doing so. |

The levels of the graveness of the variants are probably inherently different and deserve research. For example, deaction may be graver than other variants.

It may be valid to explore the reason or incentive of the inaction, which can be irresponsibility or conflict of interest. Conflict of interest is probably always of greater graveness.

It is crucial to understand an inaction in dependence is on par with an action not in dependence, and an action in dependence is graver than an action not in dependence.

#### Burden of proof

In many dependence relationships, the depender is unable to collect or preserve evidence. In such cases, the burden of proof lies in the dependee. The dependee is obliged to collect and preserve evidence to prove there is no breach of dependence. If there is a breach of dependence and some harm is done, the dependee takes full responsibility unless it can prove the degree of the harm done by the breach.

#### Conservation of dependence

Dependence does not disappear or degrade when it is transferred to another person, temporarily or permanently. For example, if a child is left to a carer, be it a childcare worker, a teacher, or a doctor, all the dependence-related obligations of its parents are fully transferred to the carer.

#### Inclusiveness

The relationship of dependence is not exclusive to other relationships, such as contract. For example, a captain-passenger relationship is both a commercial contract for transportation and dependence.

#### Existing laws

Only some aforementioned examples of dependence have been legislated, in some countries, and to different extents. Some examples include:

- Child neglect is a crime.
- Airliner pilots are not allowed to use parachutes.
- Hit-and-run is a crime.
- Military desertion is a crime.

The generalization of dependence has not been done. The legal concept of dependence has not been formed.

Sensible generalization in law is superior to respective laws. For example, a law can be made for burglary, another for pocket-picking, another for shop-lifting, and so on. Such legislations are poor. Only one law is needed to address all of them, which can be generalized as taking other people's belongings without their knowledge or consent. Depending on the country/legislators, it can even be generalized to incorporate robbery as taking other people's belongings without their knowledge or uncoerced consent.

The fact that dependence has not been generalized is the reason some serious criminal (in)acts are left unchecked.

#### Fiduciary responsibility

Fiduciary responsibility is the closest legal interpersonal relationship to dependence. Both do not allow conflict of interest.

Fiduciary responsibility may work in the financial field. When it comes to a person's fundamental legal rights, such as health and life, fiduciary responsibility is an inferior understanding and often does not work because it is not grave enough. It should be replaced by dependence.

#### Government officials

It seems to be hard or even impossible to criminalize government officials for their actions and inactions. The privilege is the continuation of a ruler's power from pre-democratic ages, when the ruler could never be held accountable. However, the relationship between the government, hence the officials, and the citizens is dependence, the gravest legal relationship.

The reasons why the privilege persists in democratic countries include:

- It takes scientific skills to understand the nature of the government's role.
- It takes open-mindedness to not blindly follow the tradition.
- It takes integrity for one to relinquish its own power.
- It takes responsibility for one to make itself accountable.

#### Marriage

A married person may not always have the ability to take action to exercise its fundamental legal rights, such as health, life, safety, security, freedom, and justice, and it has to depend on its spouse to take action for it. Subsequently, marriage is dependence.

However, dependence is so grave that one may have to risk its life for its spouse and breach of dependence is a crime. Legislating marriage as dependence may reduce the marriage rate and change the social layout, which may be too open-minded for some people.

The following examples make sense, even if the relationship between two spouses is so bad that it is on the brink of termination:

- One gets a sickness after marriage that is so severe that it cannot take care of itself, its spouse has to take care of the former until it is able to take care of itself again. Whether a divorce in such a situation is allowed is a different matter. The obligation must be fulfilled.
- One must try its best, including risking its life, to rescue its drowning spouse.
- A husband must protect his wife in dangerous situations, such as a robbery.

Besides being dependence, marriage is a contract that has predefined unoverridable clauses for rights and obligations not on dependence level.
