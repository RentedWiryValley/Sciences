## Definition of money

Money is a quantified representation of the value of past contributions that can be redeemed for future contributions of the same value from any party in the relevant society. The purpose of money is to exchange contributions flexibly.

#### Functions explained

Money is said to have the following functions:

- Medium of exchange: Money is a medium of exchange because it is a medium and a means to exchange contributions.
- Unit of account: Money is a unit of account because it is a quantified representation of the value of contributions.
- Store of value: Money is a store of value because it is a redeemable representation of the value of contributions.

Money is also said to be debt. Money is debt because it can be redeemed for contributions from the society, which effectively means the society is in debt to its owner.

#### Discussions

The most important keyword of the definition is contribution, which is missing in preexisting definitions of money. Either money is misunderstood, or its definition is manipulated by the money businesses, mainly the banking system. Monetarists have added boosting the economy as a function of money, which is a hijack of the original purpose of money.

It is crucial to understand that contributions only include goods and labor. There is no such thing as a contribution of money because money is only a representation of old contributions. Only people can make (new) contributions.

Since goods cannot generate new/more goods and labor cannot generate new/more labor, contributions cannot generate new/more contributions. Since contributions cannot generate new/more contributions, money cannot generate new/more money. Subsequently, the following economic phenomena/activities are invalid:

- Interest
- Investment
- Passive income from investments
- Trading, for example, stocks, futures, and so on

In other words, commercial banks (and many other economic phenomena/activities) are invalid.

Since money is debt, money printing is invalid. When a government prints money, it effectively makes its people (and foreign ones who use the same money) owe to it, without making any contributions. Money printing is effectively theft. In other words, one of the primary functions of central banks is invalid.

In short, most of the banking system is invalid by the definition of money.

The content of this article will be attacked by economists, who are either directly or indirectly sponsored by the banking system. The modern economy has been hijacked by the banking system for about a century, since the establishment of the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. Theories have been created to justify banking-based, i.e., debt-based, economy. Laws have been made to protect it. Even the Nobel Prize ends up including a [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences), which is funded by Sweden's central bank and not one of the Nobel Prizes but recognized by most as one, i.e., the Nobel Prize in Economics.

#### Exchange of contributions

Once it is understood that the purpose of money is to exchange contributions, alternatives to money can be explored. With modern technologies, such as computers/smartphones and the internet, systems can be built to exchange contributions, be it goods or labor, without involving money. People with little or no money can have a better life, as long as they have goods or labor to offer.

"Circle of Contributions" is a high-level technical design of a solution to exchange of contributions without money.

#### Circle of Contributions

Circle of Contributions (CoC) is a design for a software platform in which people exchange contributions in a circular manner. Members of the platform submit their needs as well as their offers, i.e., goods or labor. The software matches needs and offers from different participants and forms circles of contributions. Each participant in a circle gets what it wants from the last participant in the circle and serves the next participant in the circle. CoC can be based on legal contracts.

It is crucial that there is no creation of money of any kind in CoC. Contributions must be settled and cleared in every circle. If one fails to contribute to the next participant, the latter will be the debtee of the former. The latter cannot get a credit of any kind that can be redeemed from other members, which is effectively money. The system will fail if the creation of money is allowed.

Some advantages and disadvantages of CoC compared to money are as follows:

Advantages:

- Poor/unemployed participants can get goods and services.
- Participants cannot be exploited by monetary policies.
- Debt chains that go in circles are not possible.

Disadvantages:

- CoC is not as flexible as money.
- CoC does not have the same precision as money.
