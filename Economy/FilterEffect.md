## Filter effect of money

Filter effect of money is the phenomenon that the rich are more benefited financially when the money in the society moves. Filter effect takes place on all levels, from businesses to the banking system. The banks are the most benefited.

Filter effect is the actual reason why the [velocity of money](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity_of_money) is kept high.

#### The banking system

The banking system is tightly connected to debut-based economy, high money velocity, consumerism, and overpopulation. It is the root of debut-based economy. It advocates high money velocity. It is the main reason for overpopulation. Debut-based economy and high money velocity are why consumerism is promoted. Overpopulation increases consumption.

Consumerism and overpopulation ensure overconsumption. Overconsumption is the main reason for planet-scale pollution, global warming, and climate change. To save the planet, or more accurately, humanity, the influence of the banking system must be minimized.

#### Discussions

The content of this article will be attacked by economists, who are either directly or indirectly sponsored by the banking system. The modern economy has been hijacked by the banking system for about a century, since the establishment of the Federal Reserve System, the central banking system of the United States. Theories have been created to justify banking-based, i.e., debt-based, economy. Laws have been made to protect it. Even the Nobel Prize ends up including a [Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Sciences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nobel_Memorial_Prize_in_Economic_Sciences), which is funded by Sweden's central bank and not one of the Nobel Prizes but recognized by most as one, i.e., the Nobel Prize in Economics.
